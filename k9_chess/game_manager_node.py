class GameManagerNode(Node):
    """
    ROS 2 node that manages interaction between the robot and Lichess.

    Responsibilities:
    - Connect to the Lichess API and listen for incoming events (challenges, game starts, etc.).
    - Accept challenges automatically.
    - Start a stream of game updates when a game begins.
    - Maintain and publish the current board state (as FEN) and game events.
    - Provide services to start or stop games (challenge players, resign, abort).

    Design notes:
    - Lichess provides a long-lived HTTP stream for lobby events and per-game updates.
    - These are read incrementally using `.iter_lines()`, which is a blocking generator.
    - To keep the ROS 2 executor responsive, the code uses ROS timers that periodically
      "drain" a few lines from each stream. This avoids blocking the main thread.
